## How to use
First of all, be aware that (a) the system's arrays have a max size of 20 (anything higher than that will be setted to the max) and (b) it only works with natural numbers (N = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4...}). (b) is also valid for the numbers inside the arrays. So if a lower number is used, it will be setted to the min.
